This is the default project demo folder. It is only intended to run a demo
system for an out-of-the-box install. It is recommended to NOT use this folder.
Use the project folder in the root folder. Or, somewhere outside and then set the environment variable VYTRONICS_PROJDIR prior to starting the server.

Environment variables may include indirect references using
a string ${MY_ENV_VAR}. This allows environment variables to be
specified that might not be defined prior to application launch
as is the case with most hosted environments (i.e. OpenShift and Cloud9).
The indirect references may be embedded in the variable string. For
example:

setenv VYTRONICS_PROJDIR ${OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR}/myproject

Multiple indirect variables can be inside the string and will be
expanded when the server first starts up.
